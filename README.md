# A Statistical Analysis of the Accounts Payable Process

## Executive Summary

This project investigates operational inefficiencies in the Accounts Payable (AP) process for an anonymous multinational retailer (Company X). By analyzing nearly 30,000 cases across vendors and employees, we identified:

- Vendor-specific inefficiencies (especially in Canada and Germany)
- Bottlenecks in the AP process flow
- Disparities in employee productivity
- Opportunities for automation through Evaluated Receipts Settlements (ERS)

Our recommendations combine short-term process adjustments with long-term automation to potentially unlock **over $10 million in value**, improving throughput times and preparing Company X to scale.

## Introduction

Company X is a consumer retailer in the home goods industry, operating for 14 years with global headquarters in Germany and the US. Despite significant growth, they lag behind peers in process automation, reporting a **10% lower automation rate than the German industry average**.

Our analysis focused on the Accounts Payable process, aiming to:

- Identify reliable vendors for global expansion
- Pinpoint employee performance gaps
- Propose automation strategies
- Quantify how these improvements translate into revenue growth

## Methods

- Completed **Celonis process mining certifications** to effectively use their EMS tool
- Explored multiple datasets, selecting Accounts Payable for its strategic impact
- Conducted data analysis in **Excel** and **Celonis EMS**
- Engaged with Celonis representatives, professors, and local business experts
- Validated insights through peer presentations and feedback sessions

## Findings

### IDES Canada
- Accounts for **14% of AP cases** with a **97% rate of invoice cancellations**.
- None of the cases followed the standard AP process.
- **Action:** Recommend task force oversight and placing Canada on “process improvement notice” until 50% conformance is achieved.

### IDES AG (Germany)
- Represents **49% of AP volume**, with **66% following the standard process**.
- Major violations include late due dates and frequent baseline date changes.
- **Action:** Assign dedicated employees to prioritize Germany, ensuring stronger vendor relations and process stability.

### IDES United States & United Kingdom
- Smaller shares (**13% US, 7% UK**) but highly efficient.
- US has a bottleneck between clearing invoices and due dates (16-day delay in 95% of cases).
- UK delays occur between invoice creation and scanning (adding **~49 days**).
- **Action:** Minimal changes needed beyond minor automation notifications.

### Employee vs. Automation Rates
- Overall automation at **87%**, with some employees performing only **3% of total activities**.
- By raising all to at least **5%**, Company X could process **~2,100 more cases**, unlocking **over $10 million in potential revenue**.

### Evaluated Receipts Settlement (ERS)
- Proposes replacing manual invoice processes with ERS to:
  - Eliminate manual errors (reducing canceled invoices)
  - Cut down process steps (like scanning/entering invoices)
  - Pay bills on precise due dates
- Benchmarks from Whirlpool indicate substantial long-term savings.

---

## Conclusion & Recommendations

Our multi-pronged strategy combines:

- **Short-term:** Train employees, benchmark productivity, and monitor underperforming vendors.
- **Long-term:** Implement ERS to drive automation, reduce manual errors, and free staff for higher-value work.

Together, these changes could save Company X **over $10 million**, support growth, and strengthen their competitive position against major industry players.
